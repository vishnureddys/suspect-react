<h1>Suspect Management System</h1>
<p>This is a project where a witness can identify the suspect without actually revealing his identity.</p>

<p>This makes use of Python3, Django and react(still implementing).</p>

<h1> Commands to run the code: </h1>
<p>Come to the suspect directory.</p>
<p>Activate a virtual environment and then type the following commands</p>

$ python -m pip install Django
$ pip install django-crispy-forms
$ pip install django-phonenumber-field[phonenumberslite]
<br>
You could be asked to install Pillow
```$ python -m pip install Pillow
```
<br>
Now you can run the server:
```$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
```
<br>
Now head over to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the website.
<br>
After logging in you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts to look at the suspects and identify the criminal.
You can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to go to the admin page.
